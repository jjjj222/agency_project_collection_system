The customerâ€™s problem involves pairing non-profit organizations with students and faculty in order to complete service projects. Currently, there are many students and faculty who would like to do service projects in exchange for experience, as well as many nonprofits and other agencies who have projects to get accomplished with limited budget. However, it is often difficult to raise awareness of these projects, so many go unnoticed. In the course of this project, we designed a website to connect agencies with A&M students and faculty through volunteer projects. Agencies can post projects which A&M students and faculty can then browse through to volunteer for projects relevant to their expertise.

A major emergent requirement became more evident as the project evolved: the need to monitor the website. The customer made it clear that any time students interacted with the public required close supervision, which was provided for by adding numerous admin capabilities. Tamu Users could be blocked, and agencies, projects, faculty status, and completion of projects all needed to be approved or unapproved. Basically, almost every public-facing action from users needs to be approved by the admin.
